/**
 * Useful math tidbits
 * <p>
 * These general utility functions can provide useful mathematical
 * manipulations for robots if a dedicated math library is not used.
 * These are not optimized and may have significant performance issues.
 * Please carefully consider whether or not a dedicated math package would be
 * a better fit before electing to use the package.
 * <p>
 * Included are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Basic matricies</li>
 *     <li>Least square regressions</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Please use Jama based classes and include the library if performance becomes
 * an issue (WIP, not implemented yet).
